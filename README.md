# JPMC Task 1
Starter repo for task 1 of the JPMC software engineering program

# Task 1: Interface with a stock price data feed
##Set-Up
Before you can tackle any software development task, you need to set up your development environment. You
can think of your local development environment as a virtual workbench with all the tools necessary to
work on your project. To set up your dev environment, follow these instructions:
-  Install python 3 to your system - any recent version of python 3 will work fine, though the most
up-to-date version is advisable. If you need help with this step, check out this excellent guide
from real python: https://realpython.com/installing-python/
 
-  Fork and clone the starter repo here: https://github.com/theforage/forage-jpmc-swe-task-1
    -  IMPORTANT! Uncheck the “Copy the main branch only” box in the fork dialog on GitHub. A model answer
has been provided in a separate branch from main.
    -  if you are unfamiliar with forking, cloning, or git in general, take a look at the first two chapters
of the git book here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2
 
-  Open the project in your IDE of choice - if you don’t have a favourite python IDE yet, take a look at Pycharm
Community Edition. It’s a well-designed IDE by Jetbrains packed with features and plugins, powerful enough to
work on the most complex projects, and entirely free.
 
-  Create a new virtual environment in the project root. Pycharm can do this automatically for you using the
“configure python interpreter” option in settings.
 
-  Install all project dependencies. These are listed in the requirements.txt file.

# Notes
